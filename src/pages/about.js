      <p>
        I'm a software engineer passionate about software design, coding, and
        learning new technologies. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Software
        Engineering from Penn State Behrend in 2017. Since then, I have been
        working as a Software Engineer at Erie Insurance, a Fortune 500
        insurance company located in Erie, Pennsylvania. In my free time, I
        enjoy music production, coding, listening to podcasts, and learning.
